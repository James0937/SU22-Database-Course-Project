# Title: Chicago Airbnb Data Analysis

## Project Summary
The project seeks to provide guidance and a detailed analysis of Airbnb's houses in Chicago. This project utilizes the Airbnb datasets to provide an overview of housing information in Chicago. Users can use database functionality to search for the entry of a specific house, find the closest house near them, see an overview of Chicago with its districts, or use the website to see the exact location and information of each house on a map.

## Description
This project would like to help users to find a suitable house in Chicago. If provided with a location, this application can search for the closest house near them. The users can also use constraints to filter the result, such as prices or ratings.

Besides searching, the user can also use the map mode to examine the Chicago from above and find the ideal house on the map. This can help users to have an intuitive view of the distribution of Airbnb houses in Chicago. They can choose their houses while considering the condition of the surroundings, such as the closest restaurants and shops to the houses.


## Usefulness
This project works as a combination of a map and a database. The user can use different methods to locate their ideal houses. It is similar to the Airbnb website, but this project offers a better user experience. The original Airbnb website uses a build-in map, which is difficult to operate. However, with this application's Google Maps API, the user can find the handy tools provided by Google Maps. For example, if the user wants to find a house with a gas station, it is difficult to fulfill their purpose since Google Maps does not contain all information about Airbnb houses and Airbnb's map does not contain information about the city.


## Realness
This dataset includes the Airbnb housing information about the hosts, position, description, price, etc. The position includes the latitude and longitude, which are useful for map display. The price and review scores are helpful for customers to select their ideal house. The dataset this derived from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jinbonnie/chicago-airbnb-open-data, which is part of the Airbnb dataset, and the original source can be found from Airbnb Open Data.


## Functionality
1. Show map of Chicago and clickable neighborhood (not in Google Maps, but pictures and simple HTML/CSS operations)
2. Show map of neighborhood and a list of Airbnb locations with Google Maps
3. Search the data set with specific neighborhoods
