App Link (Expired now): https://flash-garage-354803.uc.r.appspot.com/

This is the repository of the UIUC CS411 Database Systems project. It's a group project, and our team, "CDGW", consists of four individuals. The details can be checked in the file "TeamInfo.md". I used my educational account, "JamesW37 - Zhiyuan Wang", to join this repository.

We used to host this application online, but now it's expired. Its URL is https://flash-garage-354803.uc.r.appspot.com/

We also made an introduction video and posted it on Youtube. The video link is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjFDd86484c
