### Web Application Development Based on Airbnb Chicago Datasets

This is the repository of the UIUC CS411 Database Systems project. It's a group project, and our team, "CDGW", consists of four individuals. The details can be checked in the file "TeamInfo.md". I used my educational account, "JamesW37 - Zhiyuan Wang", to join this repository.

The project is aimed to provide guidance and a detailed analysis of Airbnb's houses in Chicago. This project utilizes the Airbnb datasets to provide an overview of housing information in Chicago. Users can use database functionality to search for the entry of a specific house, find the closest house near them, see an overview of Chicago with its districts, or use the website to see each house's exact location and information on a map.

We used to host this application online, but now it cannot be accessed due to the expiration of the GCP(Google Cloud Platform). Its URL is https://flash-garage-354803.uc.r.appspot.com/

We also made an introduction video and posted it on Youtube. The video link is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjFDd86484c
